<h3> Author's notes </h3>
<p> In other words, the contents of this website are <em>simple</em> and <em>accessible</em>. However, this can be much better to match the contents of my stories like <i>Gia</i>. It <strong>must</strong> be clear and <strong>succinct</strong>. This
  can be done through the <strong>strong</strong> and <b>bold</b> tags which can look the same. </p>
<h2> Lists </h2>
<p> Lists are a little different. We'll put our lists in 2 separate lists for demonstration. </p>
<p> Here is an <strong>unordered list</strong> of my favorite League champs:
  <ul>
    <li> Shen </li>
    <li> Aurelion Sol </li>
    <li> Taric </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p> And here is an <strong>ordered list</strong> of my favorite League champs:
  <ol>
    <li> Shen </li>
    <li> Aurelion Sol </li>
    <li> Taric </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p> Here is a set of <strong>definition lists</strong>:
  <dl>
    <dt><b>Amogus</b></dt>
      <dd> Amogus is a bastardized version of the name of the 2018 video game Among Us. In January 2021, the word gained popularity as a catchphrase used in ironic memes, often used to replace dialogue in cartoons, and as a way of shitposting by spamming
        the phrase alongside sus. </dd>
    <dt><b>The Circle Game</b></dt>
      <dd> The Circle Game is a game of peripheral vision, trickery and motor skills.[1] The game starts out when the Offensive Player creates a circle with their thumb and forefinger somewhere below his waist.[2] The goal is to trick another person into
        looking at his hand. </dd>

<h3> Quotes </h3>
<p> Let's quote some famous person. Here is a quote by Jesus himself on the induction of Lebron James into the Hall of Fame:
  <blockquote>
    <p> It's so sad that Steve Jobs died of ligma. Ligma balls. </p>
    <cite>- Jesus H. Christ</cite>
  </blockquote>
